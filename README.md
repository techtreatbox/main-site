[TechTreatBox](https://techtreatbox.com) is a **blog about technology** from a programmer's perspective. We write not only about shiny gadgets but we also pay a lot of attention to the office equipment and health in general. We all spend a lot of time behind the desk putting our health at risk. That's why our blog aims to help people who are exactly like us.

So far we created a child-theme for a [WordPress repository theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/yocto/), but we are working on a very bespoke theme, which will be available here for free. Keep tuned!
